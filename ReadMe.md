# Meeting Planner
## Function
The program is designed to help families organise events together. It helps tell them when someone has an individual event and when there is a family event.
## How it works
1) The program asks for the date, year and month to know what day it is
2) It generates the calendar and two entry boxes and two buttons
3) One set of entry box and button is for inputting a family event
4) Another is for family events
5) When a family event is input, the box with the date where it was input turns green
6) For non-family events, the box turns red
7) This allows people to know when there are non-family events to help plan around those events
